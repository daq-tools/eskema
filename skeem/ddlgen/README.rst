About ``skeem.ddlgen``
######################

The code within ``skeem.ddlgen`` is vendored from the excellent
`ddlgenerator`_ by `Catherine Devlin`_, thank you so much!

It has been slightly adjusted, mostly by using monkey-patching, and it would be
sweet if some of the corresponding patches could make it back to upstream in
one way or another.
